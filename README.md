DPLogistics

The application processes orders to move items (products) from one (or more) facilities to a destination facility.<br>
These items are processed at the source facility (retrieved from stock, packaged, packed into containers).<br>
The containered items are then loaded onto transport trucks.<br>
These trucks then transport the ordered items over approved shipping routes.<br>
The ordered items are unloaded, unpacked and delivered to their destination facility.<br>

This application performs these Order Processing & Logistics functions – it automatically processes customer orders – a very time-intensive process when done manually. The input of information, order processing, and results generation all are handled by the application.
