The application will process orders to move items (products) from one (or more) facilities to a destination facility.
These items must be processed at the source facility (retrieved from stock, packaged, packed into containers).
The containered items are then loaded onto transport trucks.
These trucks then transport the ordered items over approved shipping routes.
The ordered items are unloaded, unpacked and delivered to their destination facility.

This application performs these Order Processing & Logistics functions – it automatically processes customer orders – a very time-intensive process when done manually. The input of information, order processing, and results generation all are handled by the application.
